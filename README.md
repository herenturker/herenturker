# Hi there, I'm Habil Eren ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a passionate **software developer** with a deep interest in low-level programming. Ever since I was a child, I've been captivated by how technology works. This curiosity drives me to explore and create innovative solutions using software development. 

- Iâ€™m currently diving into **Assembly language and Rust** to get better at low-level programming.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **open-source low-level projects**.
- Fun fact: I enjoy dismantling gadgets to see how they work (and sometimes putting them back together!).
-  And decided to be a software engineer when I was 8!
